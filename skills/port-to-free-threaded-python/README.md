# Skill: port a package to free-threaded Python

Take a package to **correct behavior on the free-threaded (no-GIL) CPython build**
([PEP 703](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/); the `cp313t`/`cp314t` "t" ABI) and to
**declaring support**, so importing it
doesn't silently switch the GIL back on. For pure Python that's a thread-safety review;
for a C/C++/Cython/pybind11/nanobind/Rust-PyO3 extension it also means fixing data
races and shipping a `cp3Xt` wheel. The content is framework-neutral Markdown; the same
files drive multiple coding agents.

## Why do this (and why not)

**Payoff.** Real multi-core parallelism for threaded Python plus native code, without
multiprocessing's pickling/IPC overhead. It's already mainstream — a Sept 2026 scan of
the top 360 PyPI packages found **~70% of those shipping compiled wheels already ship a
free-threaded one**. And if an extension *doesn't* declare support, every user on a
free-threaded interpreter silently loses parallelism: importing it re-enables the GIL
process-wide.

**Two separate jobs, kept distinct.** *Declaring support* (a `Py_mod_gil` slot or
one-line binding flag) is what stops that GIL re-enable — cheap and a no-op on the normal
build. *Being race-free* is the real engineering: without the GIL, code that was
"accidentally thread-safe" (shared caches, module globals, borrowed references) now
races. A declaration not backed by safe code just ships a lie.

**Scope — detect broadly, fix conservatively.** The skill flags **all** unprotected
shared state but only fixes the simple, local cases (borrowed→strong swaps, a single
atomic, a self-contained critical section / `PyMutex`, the declaration). Structural
redesign — global→thread-local conversion, non-reentrant-library locking, multi-lock
ordering — is reported to the maintainer, not attempted.

**Costs.** ~1–8% single-threaded overhead on the free-threaded build (the normal build
is untouched); the audit is genuine work; and until Python 3.15's `abi3t` you ship a
*second* wheel per version. The full rationale, PEP 703 internals, and detection
heuristics live in [`reference/background.md`](reference/background.md) and
[`reference/thread-safety.md`](reference/thread-safety.md).

**When _not_ to reach for this skill.** The single-wheel **`abi3t`** ABI mechanics
([PEP 803](https://peps.python.org/pep-0803/) + [PEP 793](https://peps.python.org/pep-0793/)
`PyModExport`, opaque `PyObject`) belong to
[`port-to-python-limited-api`](../port-to-python-limited-api/) — thread-safety and ABI
stability are orthogonal; run this for the former, that for the latter.

## Layout

The workflow (in `SKILL.md`) runs: get a free-threaded interpreter and a baseline → do
the pure-Python thread-safety pass → declare support → detect races and fix the simple
ones (report the rest) → build `cp3Xt` wheels → test under load (`pytest-run-parallel`,
TSan) → verify and declare done. The files:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | The workflow — 8 ordered steps + frontmatter. **Source of truth.** |
| `AGENTS.md` | Cross-agent entry point (Codex and other `AGENTS.md`-aware agents). |
| `reference/background.md` | What free-threading is, PEP 703 internals, detection, the GIL-re-enable trap, cost/benefit, abi3 vs abi3t — the "why". |
| `reference/declaring-support.md` | `Py_mod_gil` / `PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL`, the per-binding declarations (Cython/pybind11/nanobind/PyO3), the trove classifier. |
| `reference/thread-safety.md` | Detection heuristics, the detect-vs-fix scope boundary, borrowed-reference hazards, critical sections / `PyMutex` / atomics, global state and caches. |
| `reference/build-and-test.md` | `cp3Xt` wheels per backend + cibuildwheel; TSan, `pytest-run-parallel`, running the GIL-disabled interpreter. |

`SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` point at the same `reference/` files; only `SKILL.md`
carries the full step list, so there is no duplicated workflow to maintain.
